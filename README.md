# Prediction-with-Regression
Simple Regression Assignment


 Use Case 1: Predicting Delivery Time Based on Sorting Time
Objective: Estimate delivery time from sorting time.
Dataset Size: 10 rows
Regression Equation: Delivery Time = 3 × Sorting Time + 15
R² Score: 1.0 (Perfect fit)
Insight: Sorting time directly influences delivery time with perfect predictability (in this dataset).

Use Case 2: Predicting Salary Based on Years of Experience
Objective: Predict employee salary from years of experience.
Dataset Size: 30 rows
Regression Equation: Salary = 9423.82 × YearsExperience + 25321.58
R² Score: 0.90 (Strong linear relationship)
Insight: Salary increases steadily with experience, and the model offers reliable predictions for HR use.
